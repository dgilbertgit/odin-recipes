     <h2>Description</h2>
     <p>These mashed potatoes are too fattening to have on a regular basis. I only make these on holidays, and everyone wonders what's in them that's makes them so rich.</p>
     <h3>Ingredients</h3>
     <ul>
        <li>5 pounds red potatoes, peeled and quartered</li>
        <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>1/2 cup butter</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
     </ul>
     <h4>Steps</h4>
     <ol>
        <li>Place potatoes in a large pot with enough water to cover.</li>
        <li>Bring to a boil, and cook until fork tender, about 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Drain, add butter, and mash using a potato masher, ricer or mixer.</li>
        <li>Gradually beat in the heavy cream. Serve hot!</li>
     </ol>
